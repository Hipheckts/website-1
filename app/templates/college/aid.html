<h2>Financial Aid</h2>

<p>Financial Aid is based solely on demonstrated financial need (your family's ability to pay for college expenses based on an analysis of income and assets) versus the cost of attending a college (tuition, fees, room, board, books, and personal expenses). If there is a gap between the expected family contribution and the cost of attending the college, this gap is referred to as demonstrated financial need. Since college costs vary, the financial aid package is also likely to vary from college to college. The only constant is usually the amount a family is expected to contribute. To determine a family's expected financial contribution (EFC) and the amount of demonstrated need, colleges require your parents to submit a financial statement called the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). This form is available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov. Many colleges also require the CSS: Profile, also available online at <a href="http://profileonline.collegeboard.com/index.jsp" target="_blank">http://profileonline.collegeboard.com/index.jsp</a> . These forms should be completed by parents and submitted as soon as possible after January 1st of the student's senior year.  For the CSS Profile, in cases where your parents are divorced or separated, most colleges will still require information from both parents.</p>

<p>Need-based financial aid typically comes in the form of a "financial aid package" that includes grants (gift aid that does not have to be paid back), loans (money that has to be repaid), and student employment (money that is paid directly to you for work on campus). Grants can come from the federal and state governments, the college, and private endowments. Loans are available to students and parents from the federal government, private lending agencies or banks, or the college, itself. Employment (or "workstudy") comes through the college as compensation for an assigned job. For more information about the types and sources of financial aid, visit http://www.nasfaa.org.</p>

<p>In contrast to financial aid, scholarships are not based on need but are awards made in recognition of academic merit and/or outstanding talents. Areas such as leadership, academics, music, and athletics are frequently among those singled out for scholarship awards. Students who will be applicants for financial aid/scholarship should indicate their intentions on their admission applications and adhere to the requirements and deadlines of their schools' required financial aid applications (if applicable).</p>

<p>While the FAFSA may not be filed before January 1st of the senior year, students applying for Early Decision or Early Action may apply earlier for financial aid. All colleges offering early admission programs provide some type of early need analysis form, and all colleges accepting students under ED/EA will provide an estimated financial aid package. Most selective private colleges will use the CSS Profile online form for this purpose. Students who file early for financial aid must also comply with the college's FAFSA and CSS Profile requirements after January 1. Consult each college's admissions and financial aid Web sites for specific instructions on how to apply for financial aid as an ED or EA candidate.</p>

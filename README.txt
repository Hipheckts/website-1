  What is this?
  -------------
  This is an intended replacement for the LASA High School website
  <http://www.lasahighschool.com>, written in python using flask.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------
  The latest source can be found at <https://github.com/lasa/website>.

  Installation
  ------------
  It's probably best to run this in a python venv. After you set that
  up, install the packages located in requirements.txt.

  Docs
  ----
  The docs will be written when the website is roughly feature
  complete and we get our first working semi-stable version.

  Tests
  -----
  Same story with tests.
